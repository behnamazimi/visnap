ViSnap integrates into your development process in several ways, from initial setup to daily development and CI/CD pipelines. Here are the common workflows teams use, with real-world examples to help you choose the right approach for your project.

## Local Development

### Setup Workflow

1. **Initialize ViSnap:**
   ```bash
   npx visnap init
   ```

2. **Configure your adapters** (Storybook or URLs) and browser settings

3. **Create baseline screenshots:**
   ```bash
   npx visnap update
   ```

This creates your "source of truth" screenshots that represent the correct appearance of your UI. You'll commit these baseline screenshots to your repository so your team has a shared reference.

### Development Workflow

1. **Make UI changes** to your components or pages

2. **Run visual tests:**
   ```bash
   npx visnap test
   ```

3. **Review results** in the generated HTML report:
   ```bash
   npx visnap open
   ```

4. **Update baselines** for intentional changes:
   ```bash
   npx visnap update
   ```

5. **Commit your changes** knowing your UI is consistent

**Example scenario:** You're updating a button component's hover state. After making the change, run `visnap test` to see if any other components were affected. If the change looks good, update the baselines with `visnap update` and commit both your code changes and the new baseline screenshots.

### Filtering

Focus on what matters by filtering test cases:

**Command-line filtering:**
```bash
npx visnap test --include "Button/*" --exclude "*-skip*"
```

**Configuration filtering:**
```typescript
// In your visnap.config.ts
options: {
  include: ["Button/*", "Card/*"],
  exclude: ["*-skip*", "*-test*"]
}
```

## CI/CD Pipelines

### Docker Workflow

Use Docker for consistent testing across different environments:

```bash
# Run tests in Docker
npx visnap test --docker

# Update baselines in Docker
npx visnap update --docker
```

This ensures reproducible results across different machines and environments.

### Best Practices

- **Use Docker in CI** to ensure consistent results
- **Cache dependencies** to speed up CI runs
- **Upload test artifacts** for review
- **Set appropriate timeouts** for visual tests
- **Handle failures gracefully** with proper error reporting
