description: Choose and tune odiff or pixelmatch for your needs
---

ViviDiff supports comparison with [odiff](https://github.com/dmtrKovalenko/odiff) and [pixelmatch](https://github.com/mapbox/pixelmatch) in its core.

## Choosing a Core

- `odiff`: fast, robust defaults; recommended for most projects
- `pixelmatch`: traditional per-pixel comparison; use if you need its behavior

## Configuration

```typescript
comparison: {
  core: 'odiff',        // or 'pixelmatch'
  threshold: 0.1,       // 0.0â€“1.0, higher = less strict
  diffColor: '#00ff00', // optional
}
```

## Tips

- Start with `odiff` + 0.1, adjust threshold gradually if flakiness occurs.
- Combine with CSS injection to reduce animation noise or mask an element.
