CSS injection lets you control how your UI appears during screenshot capture, helping create more stable and reliable visual tests.

## Disabling animations

Prevents flaky tests caused by elements that are still moving when screenshots are taken. You can inject CSS to pause animations, hide loading spinners, or freeze any element that might change between test runs.

## Custom CSS

Lets you hide or modify elements that shouldn't appear in your visual tests. This is useful for hiding timestamps, user-specific content, or third-party widgets that change frequently but aren't part of your core UI. You can also use CSS injection for [element masking](/docs/testing-features/element-masking) by overlaying elements to stabilize screenshots.

## Configuration

Add an `injectCSS` option to your browser adapter settings. The CSS you provide will be injected into every page before screenshots are taken.
