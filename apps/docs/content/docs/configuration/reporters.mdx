Generate test reports in different formats for various use cases.

## Configuration

```ts
// visnap.config.ts|js
reporter: {
  html: true,  // interactive HTML report (or a string path for custom location)
  json: true   // machine-readable JSON report (or a string path for custom location)
}
```

<ApiTable
  title="Reporter Options"
  caption="Controls the output formats and destinations for reports."
  rows={ApiTable.defineRows([
    {
      name: "html",
      type: "boolean | string",
      default: "true",
      description:
        "Enable HTML report. Use a string to specify a custom output path.",
      href: "#html",
    },
    {
      name: "json",
      type: "boolean | string",
      default: "true",
      description:
        "Enable JSON report. Use a string to specify a custom output path.",
      href: "#json",
    },
  ])}
  anchorPrefix="reporter"
/>

## HTML

Generate an interactive report suitable for visual review. When set to a string, the value is interpreted as the output path.

The HTML report includes:

- Visual diff comparison
- Side-by-side baseline vs current screenshots
- Test results summary
- Filtering and search capabilities

## JSON

Generate a machine-readable report for CI/CD. When set to a string, the value is interpreted as the output path.

The JSON report includes:

- Test results data
- Diff statistics
- Error information
- Metadata for programmatic processing

## Both Reporters

You can enable both simultaneously by setting both options to true (or providing custom paths for each).

## Report Location

Reports are saved in your configured screenshot directory:

```
visnap/
├── base/     # Baseline screenshots
├── current/  # Current screenshots
├── diff/     # Diff images
└── report.html  # HTML report
└── report.json  # JSON report
```
