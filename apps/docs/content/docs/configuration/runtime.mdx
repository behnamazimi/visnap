Control how tests execute with runtime configuration options.

## Concurrency

Control how many tests run in parallel. You can set a single numeric concurrency (applies to both capture and compare), or provide separate limits.

```typescript
runtime: {
  // single number (applies to capture and compare)
  maxConcurrency: 4,
  // Or separate concurrency limits
  // maxConcurrency: { capture: 4, compare: 4 },
  quiet: false
}
```

### Separate Concurrency Limits

Fine-tune performance by setting different limits for capture and comparison:

```typescript
runtime: {
  maxConcurrency: { 
    capture: 4,    // 4 screenshots at once
    compare: 2     // 2 comparisons at once
  }
}
```

## Quiet Mode

Suppress output except errors:

```typescript
runtime: {
  quiet: true
}
```

## Performance Tips

- **Higher concurrency** = faster execution but more memory usage
- **Lower concurrency** = slower execution but more stable on resource-constrained systems
- **Capture concurrency** affects browser resource usage
- **Compare concurrency** affects CPU usage for image processing
