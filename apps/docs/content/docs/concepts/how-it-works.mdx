ViSnap catches visual changes in your UI through a simple yet powerful workflow that compares screenshots over time.

## The Testing Process

### 1. Establishing Baselines
First, you create **baseline images** - these are your "source of truth" screenshots that represent the correct appearance of your UI. Running `visnap update` captures these reference images under controlled conditions.

### 2. Capturing Test Snapshots
During testing, `visnap test` takes fresh screenshots of your current UI using the exact same conditions as your baselines. This ensures fair comparisons between what you expect and what actually renders.

### 3. Detecting Changes
ViSnap automatically compares each new snapshot against its corresponding baseline. When differences exceed your configured threshold, it generates **diff images** that visually highlight exactly what changed - making it easy to spot both intended updates and unexpected regressions.

## Results & Storage

All images (baselines, current snapshots, and diffs) are saved to your filesystem according to your configuration settings. You can browse these files directly in your file explorer for detailed inspection.

Beyond raw files, ViSnap provides two complementary reporting formats:
- **[HTML Report](/docs/reference/configuration#html-reporter)**: Interactive visual comparisons with side-by-side views and highlighted differences
- **[JSON Report](/docs/reference/configuration#json-reporter)**: Structured data perfect for CI/CD pipelines and automated decision-making
