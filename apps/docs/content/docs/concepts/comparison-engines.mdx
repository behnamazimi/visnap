description: Understanding how ViSnap detects visual differences
---

ViSnap compares images using either [odiff](https://github.com/dmtrKovalenko/odiff) or [pixelmatch](https://github.com/mapbox/pixelmatch) to detect visual changes in your UI.

## How Visual Comparison Works

When ViSnap runs tests, it:

1. **Captures** a fresh screenshot of your current UI
2. **Compares** it against the baseline image using your chosen engine
3. **Calculates** the difference percentage based on your threshold
4. **Generates** a diff image highlighting changes (if any)

The comparison engine determines how this process works and how sensitive it is to changes.

## Available Engines

### odiff (Default)

**Best for:** Most projects, especially those with dynamic content

- **Fast and robust** with smart defaults
- **Handles anti-aliasing** and sub-pixel rendering differences well
- **Less sensitive** to minor rendering variations
- **Recommended** for most use cases

### pixelmatch

**Best for:** When you need precise per-pixel control

- **Classic per-pixel comparison** approach
- **More sensitive** to tiny changes
- **Predictable behavior** - every pixel difference counts
- **Use when** you need exact pixel-perfect comparisons

## Threshold Sensitivity

The threshold controls how different pixels must be to count as a change:

- **0.0** — No differences allowed (very strict)
- **0.1** — Recommended starting point (10% difference)
- **1.0** — All differences ignored (very loose)

## Choosing the Right Engine

### Use odiff when:
- You have components with subtle animations
- You're testing across different browsers
- You want fewer false positives
- You're getting started with visual testing

### Use pixelmatch when:
- You need pixel-perfect accuracy
- You're testing icons or precise UI elements
- You want to catch the smallest changes
- You have a stable, controlled testing environment

## Best Practices

- **Start with odiff + 0.1 threshold** - tune gradually based on noise and flakiness
- **Use CSS injection** to disable animations/transitions during capture
- **Increase threshold** for components with subtle animations or dynamic content
- **Decrease threshold** for precise UI (icons, typography, fine lines)
- **Test across browsers** to find the right balance for your project

## Configuration

Configure your comparison engine in `visnap.config.ts`:

```ts
comparison: {
  core: 'odiff',        // or 'pixelmatch'
  threshold: 0.1,       // 0.0–1.0; higher = less strict
  diffColor: '#00ff00', // optional highlight color
}
```

See the [Configuration Reference](/docs/reference/configuration) for all available options.
