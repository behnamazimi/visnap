title: Why ViSnap
description: Why visual testing matters and how ViSnap helps
---

Ever shipped a CSS change that broke something you didn't expect? Or had a component look different across browsers? Traditional tests miss these visual issues because they only check if code runs, not how it looks.

ViSnap catches what your other tests can't see â€” layout shifts, color changes, font rendering differences, and subtle UI bugs that slip through. It works with your existing Storybook stories or any website, automatically taking screenshots and comparing them to catch visual changes before users do.

## What makes it different

**Simple setup** - One config file, no complex tooling to manage  
**Works with what you have** - Storybook stories, any website, your existing workflow  
**Fast and reliable** - Smart comparison engine, stable screenshots  
**Developer-friendly** - Clear reports, easy debugging, works in CI  
**Flexible** - Test components, full pages, or both together

The goal is simple: catch visual bugs early when they're easy to fix, not after they reach users.
