ViSnap integrates into your development process in several ways, from initial setup to daily development and CI/CD pipelines. Here are the common workflows teams use:

## Local Development

**Setup workflow** starts with `visnap init` to create your configuration file. You'll choose your adapters (Storybook or URLs), set up your browsers, and configure your comparison settings. Then run `visnap update` to create your first baseline screenshots.

**Development workflow** integrates smoothly into your existing process. When you make UI changes, run `visnap test` to see what's different. Review the results, update baselines for intentional changes with `visnap update`, and commit your changes knowing your UI is consistent. For baseline updates, consider using `visnap update --docker` to ensure consistency across different environments.

**Filtering** helps you focus on what matters. Use `--include` and `--exclude` flags to run specific test cases, or configure patterns in your config file to automatically skip certain stories or URLs during testing.

## CI/CD Pipelines

**Docker workflow** ensures consistent testing across different environments. Use the `--docker` flag with any command to run ViSnap in an isolated container, which is especially useful for CI/CD pipelines where you need reproducible results across different machines.
