title: Why ViSnap
description: The case for adopting ViSnap for visual regression testing
---

ViSnap was created to catch what traditional testing often misses — visual bugs, subtle CSS tweaks, layout shifts, or rendering differences that can slip past standard functional tests. It integrates seamlessly with your existing Storybook stories or any web page, automatically taking and comparing snapshots to identify unintended visual changes before they reach users.

With a simple setup and minimal configuration, ViSnap makes visual testing easy to adopt. Instead of managing complex tools, you get an automated layer of protection that helps you develop with confidence while keeping your app’s look consistent across devices and browsers. It saves time, reduces risk, and lets teams catch visual issues early, when they’re simplest to fix.
