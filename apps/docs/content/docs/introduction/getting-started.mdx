title: Getting Started
description: Install, initialize, configure adapters, and run visual tests
---

## Initialize

The initializer creates a starter `visnap.config.ts` and helps you choose the right adapters for your project.

```npm
npx visnap init
```

## Configure

Edit `visnap.config.ts` to set up your testing environment. You'll choose between Storybook or URL adapters for test cases, configure Playwright for browser automation, and set options like comparison thresholds and viewport sizes. See [Configuration](/docs/02-configuration/config-file) for all available options.

## Create Baselines

Baseline screenshots serve as your reference point for future comparisons. These represent the "correct" state of your UI that you want to maintain.

```npm
npx visnap update
```

## Run Tests

This captures fresh screenshots and compares them against your baselines. Any differences above your threshold will be flagged as failures, helping you catch unintended visual changes.

```npm
npx visnap test
```

## Open Report or Screenshots

Review your test results through the interactive HTML report, which shows side-by-side comparisons and highlights differences. You can also browse screenshots directly if you prefer.

```npm
npx visnap open
```

## Optional: Validate and List

These commands help you verify your setup and explore what test cases are available without running the full test suite.

```npm
# Validate configuration
npx visnap validate

# List test cases without running
npx visnap list
```
