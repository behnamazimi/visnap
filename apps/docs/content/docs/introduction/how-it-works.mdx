ViSnap works by comparing snapshots of your UI to catch visual changes. Here's how it all comes together:

**Baselines** are your reference snapshots, the "correct" version of your UI that you want to maintain. When you run `visnap update`, it captures these baseline images and saves them for future comparisons.

**Snapshots** are fresh screenshots taken during testing. When you run `visnap test`, it captures new images of your current UI in the same conditions as your baselines.

**Diffs** show you exactly what changed. ViSnap compares each new snapshot against its baseline and highlights any differences above your threshold, making it easy to spot unintended changes.

**Reports** give you a clear view of what happened. The HTML report shows side-by-side comparisons with highlighted differences, while the JSON report provides data for your CI pipeline to make decisions about deployments.
