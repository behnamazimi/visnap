Thank you for your interest in contributing to visnap! This document provides guidelines for contributing to this project.

## Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/behnamazimi/visnap
   cd visnap
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```npm
   npm install
   ```

3. **Build packages**
   ```npm
   npm run build
   ```

4. **Run tests**
   ```npm
   npm run test
   ```

## Package Structure

This is a monorepo with the following packages:

- `@visnap/protocol` - Shared types and interfaces
- `@visnap/playwright-adapter` - Playwright browser integration
- `@visnap/storybook-adapter` - Storybook integration
- `@visnap/core` - Core functionality
- `visnap` - Command-line interface

All packages share the same version number (fixed versioning).

## Making Changes

### Code Style

- Follow the existing code style and patterns
- Run `npm run lint` to check for linting issues
- Run `npm run check-types` to verify there are no TypeScript type errors
- Ensure all tests pass with `npm run test`

### Creating Changesets

When making changes that should be released, you need to create a changeset:

1. **Create a changeset** describing your changes:
   ```bash
   npx changeset
   ```

2. **Follow the prompts** to:
   - Select which packages are affected (usually all packages)
   - Choose the type of change (patch, minor, major)
   - Write a clear description of the changes

3. **Include the changeset file** in your PR

**When to create a changeset:**
- ✅ Bug fixes, new features, breaking changes
- ❌ Internal refactoring, documentation updates, tests

**Write clear descriptions:**
- ✅ "Fix CLI command failing on Windows"
- ❌ "Fix bugs"

## Pull Request Process

1. Create a feature branch from `main`
2. Make your changes
3. Add tests if applicable
4. Create a changeset if the change should be released
5. Submit a pull request with a clear description

## Release Process

This project uses automated releases with Changesets:

- Once your PR with changesets is merged to `main`, a "Version Packages" PR will be automatically created
- Maintainers review and merge the version PR
- Packages are automatically published to npm

## Guidelines

- Ensure all tests pass before submitting
- Follow the existing code style and patterns
- Include tests for new functionality
- Update documentation if needed
- Create a changeset for any changes that should be released
