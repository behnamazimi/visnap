title: Getting Started
description: Install, initialize, configure adapters, and run visual tests
---

## Initialize

Run the initializer to create a starter `visnap.config.ts` and guide you through choosing adapters.

```npm
npx visnap init
```

## Configure

Edit `visnap.config.ts` to set the adapter (Storybook or URL), the browser (Playwright), and core options like thresholds and viewports. See [Configuration](/docs/configs).

## Create Baselines

Capture baseline screenshots so future test runs have something to compare against.


```npm
npx visnap update
```

## Run Tests

Take fresh screenshots and compare them to baselines; differences above the threshold will fail the run.

```npm
npx visnap test
```

## Open Report or Screenshots

Open the HTML report to review results and diffs, or browse the screenshots directly if you prefer.

```npm
npx visnap open
```

## Optional: Validate and List

Use validate to check your configuration for errors, and list to see discovered test cases without running them.

```npm
# Validate configuration
npx visnap validate

# List test cases without running
npx visnap list
```
