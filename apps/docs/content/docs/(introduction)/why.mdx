title: Why ViviDiff
description: The case for adopting ViviDiff for visual regression testing
---

ViviDiff helps you catch unwanted visual changes before they reach users. It takes screenshots of your UI, compares them to a saved baseline, and highlights differences. This gives you fast, clear feedback when a change affects layout, colors, spacing, or states.

## Features

- Run from the command line with a simple, guided experience.
- Configure the tool in a single file with clear, predictable options.
- Output rich HTML and JSON reports for quick triage and CI.
- Choose `odiff` or `pixelmatch` as the comparison engine.
- Seamless Storybook v8+ integration to test stories as rendered.
- Test custom URLs defined by you, including real app routes.
- Use Playwright to run tests in Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit for realistic coverage.
- Inject CSS to hide or mask elements before screenshots to reduce flakiness.
- Run declarative interactions before capture, with 20+ actions supported.
- Filter which cases to run or update to keep runs focused and fast.
- Set options per test case for fineâ€‘grained control.
- Run locally or in Docker for CI for consistent results.
