## What are you testing?

ViSnap needs to know what to test. You can use ViSnap with your Storybook stories, with any website or web app (using URL testing), or with both at the same time in a single project. Pick the option below that best matches your workflow:

### Testing Storybook Stories

If you're using Storybook, this is the easiest way to get started. ViSnap automatically finds and tests all your stories.

ðŸ‘‰ **[Start with Storybook Setup](/docs/guides/storybook-setup)**

### Testing Websites 

If you want to test any website, landing pages, or an app without Storybook, use the URL adapter.

ðŸ‘‰ **[Start with URL Testing](/docs/guides/url-testing)**

### Not Sure Yet?

Both guides walk you through the complete setup from installation to seeing your first visual test results. You can also use both approaches together in the same project.

## Quick Commands Reference

Once you're set up, these are the commands you'll use daily:

```npm
# Install ViSnap
npm install -D @visnap/cli
```

```npm
# Initialize ViSnap
npx visnap init
```

```npm
# Take baseline screenshots
